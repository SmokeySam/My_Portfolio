## Testing

- All links have been tested to make sure the user is taken to the right page/website.

## Credits

- I watched a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iUJJHEIpls) made by Gary Simon on making a portfolio and designing the mock-up. I followed the video, make a small few changes along the way with links, colours and hero-design. This video really helped my in understanding some UX UI and also explained some programming concepts. I also learned how to use SASS from the video. It really taught me a lot and I have learned from watching and coding from it.
