## Structure

This project was done over one long webpage. The main purpose of this site is to show my projects so I stuck to that and didnt want to take away from the main purpose.

## Features

- It has a portfolio section for my projects along with some of my other socail links if someone would like to contact me.

- Each of my profects have a title of the project, a sub-title explaining what the porject is and also a descrition of the project. If clicked on the name of the project or the image you will be bought to the webpage.

- In my navbar I have links for my LinkedIn and Github.

## Colours

- The colours used in the project were blue and white. Three different shades of blue were used along with white.

## Fonts

The font used in this project is "Poppins".

## Icons

I have used only one icon for this webpage. It is elocated in the hero image so the vistitor knows to scroll down the page to see more.

## Images

- The hero image I made in Figma using different shapes.

- Other images on the webpage are images of the projects.

# Credits

- I watched a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iUJJHEIpls) made by Gary Simon on making a portfolio and desiging the mockup. I followed the video make a small few changes along the way with links, colors and hero-design. This video really helped my in understanding some UX UI and also explained some programming concepts. I also learned how to use SASS from the video. It really tought me alot and I have learned alot from watching and coding from it.
