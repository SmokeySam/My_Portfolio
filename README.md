# UX UI :

## Colors :

- I choose to use blue as the primary and secondary colors within my project based upson personal preference of blue being my favourite color. My colors of my text are black and white. Blue is used for clickable links and icons.

## Fonts :

- I used the front "Poppins" for the project.

## Icons :

- I added my social accounts and used icons to link the accounts. Icons are also used for my skillset section to represent the area of topic.

## Designs :

- In Figma I created a random abstarct image for my page.

# Layout & Features :

- The navbar has clickable links to parts of the page including : My work, My skills and Contact me. It also has links to three of my social accounts : Linkedln, Github and Dribbble.

- Underneath the navbar is my intro and title. Beside this is a image I made.

- The project section has a heading what the application is followed by the name of the project. Beneath is a description. Along side is a image of the project which is also clickable to be directed to the project.

- Within my skill section it is broken into 3 rows : Frontend, Backend and Other. Each row has a icon followed by the heading of the skill and the technologies used beaneath.

* At the end of the webpage are my social accounts : Linkedln, GitHub, Dribbble, Twitter and Instagram.
